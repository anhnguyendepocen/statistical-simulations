# Statistical simulations
A collection of small notebooks showing some statistical properties via simulation

## ENBIK 2018

The simulations were presented at ENBIK 2018. The source for the slides (contains all computation as well) is in the file `enbik.Rmd` and can be compiled with [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/). A compiled version can be browsed at [https://www.martinmodrak.cz/post/2018-06-11-enbik/enbik.html].

The files `t_test.Rmd` and `DESeq2.Rmd` contain separate examples with t-test and DESeq2 with slightly different configuration than what was shown at ENBIK. Those are standard [RStudio Notebooks](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html)
